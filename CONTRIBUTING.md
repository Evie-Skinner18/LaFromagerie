_Contributing_
Welcome and thanks for considering making a contribution to La Fromagerie!

*Prerequisites*
- .Net 6 (download here). This is the next stage of .Net: it's cross platform, like .Net Core, so you'll be able to develop with it no matter what environment you use!
- A code editor or IDE. E.g VS Code or JetBrains Rider

*Instructions*
- Please implement your solution to one of the issues on the issues page
- Feel free to suggest a new issue if it's not already covered. Please ensure your new idea is helpful and contributes to the learning we are trying to do here about design patterns.
- Keep your local forked version up to date
- Build LaFromagerie.sln and run the unit tests
- If it all builds fine and the unit tests pass, you're ready to push!
- If there are any build failures, we will mention it in code review feedback

_Happy coding and we look forward to seeing your progress!_
