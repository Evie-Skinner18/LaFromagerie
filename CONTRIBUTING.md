_Contributing_ :star:
Welcome and thanks for considering making a contribution to La Fromagerie!

*Prerequisites*
- C#
- .Net 6 [Download from Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) This is the next stage of .Net: it's cross platform, like .Net Core, so you'll be able to develop with it no matter what environment you use!
- A code editor or IDE. E.g VS Code or JetBrains Rider

*Instructions*
- Please implement your solution to one of the issues on the issues page
- Feel free to suggest a new issue if it's not already covered. Please ensure your new idea is helpful and contributes to the learning we are trying to do here about design patterns.
- Keep your local forked version up to date
- Build LaFromagerie.sln and run the unit tests
- __(Optional)__ Install formatation tools using `dotnet tool install -g --prerelease dotnet-format`
- __(Optional)__ Format your code using `dotnet-format` command in project folder.
- If it all builds fine and the unit tests pass, you're ready to push!
- Check your commit github actions, if all test pass you can now make a pull request for us!
- If there are any build failures, we will mention it in code review feedback :rocket:

_Happy coding and we look forward to seeing your progress!_
